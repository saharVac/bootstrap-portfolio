# Personal Portfolio

Developing this portfolio taught me a great deal about working with bootstrap. Most of the time I found myself dedicating towrds positioning my elements adding empty divs here and there to take up space. I kept in mind screen responsiveness and that I should always start developing for the smallest screen size and work it up from there.
